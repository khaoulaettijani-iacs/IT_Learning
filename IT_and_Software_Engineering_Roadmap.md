#  Information Technology & Software Engineering Learning Roadmap
Welcome to my **IT and Software Engineering Learning Repository** — a space where I document my journey of mastering the foundations of **Information Technology**, **Software Development**, and **System Design** to strengthen my skills in **AI** and **Cybersecurity**.
This roadmap focuses on the essential technical areas that connect computing, networking, and software engineering together.

## What Is IT and Software Engineering?
**Information Technology (IT)** involves managing, securing, and maintaining computer systems, networks, and digital infrastructure.
**Software Engineering** focuses on designing, developing, and maintaining software applications that solve real-world problems efficiently and securely.
Together, they form the technical backbone behind all modern technologies — including AI and Cybersecurity.
